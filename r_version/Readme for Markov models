### Readme for Markov models

Run the markov model(s) by running: python markov_wrapper.py

Configurate the run in markov_params.py with the following options

qs: any country_month queryset available in views
save_name: short name of the queryset used in the save file
save_path: path in which to store the predictions, defaults to 'results/' in the working directory
EndOfHistory: the month for which to produce predictions (only when doing future predictions)
calib_partitioner_dict: should correspond to calib
test_partitioner_dict: should correspond to test
custom_partitioner_dict: for use if you want different train and predict periods
model_type: which type of markov model to be run, can be rf, glm, or both
predict_type: are these a test, calib, or future run

cleenup: logical which removes all temporary files after a run (otherwise data, params, and partitions are saved in the folder tmps)

Currently the function writes the predictions to the folder 'results' (created if does not exist) with the format markov_[sc/ss]_[month_id/calib/future]_[rf/glm].parquet.
